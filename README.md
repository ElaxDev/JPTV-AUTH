# JPTV-AUTH

 A user authentication bot for the [JPTV Club](https://jptv.club/) Discord server, but works with any [Unit3D](https://github.com/HDInnovations/UNIT3D-Community-Edition) private torrent tracker.

## Setup

  1. Run `npm install` in the bot's root folder.
  2. Create an .env file following this pattern:

    NODE_ENV=production
    TOKEN=YOUR TOKEN GOES HERE
    PREFIX=YOUR PREFIX GOES HERE

  3. Configure the keys.js file in the db folder.
  4. Use `npm run start` to start the bot.
